<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that lives on the internet. It can be used by anyone all around the world, 24/7 365 days of the year. It is a peer to peer electronic cash system and does not need a central authority to control it. Bitcoin miners that are located all around the globe validate transactions and secure the network. There will only be a total of 21 million Bitcoins to ever exist. Due to the finite supply, some people see Bitcoin as a sound form of money, along with being digital gold.</p>
<h2>History</h2>

The first Bitcoin was distributed in 2009, following the 2008 financial crisis. Bitcoin is a digital form of currency that lives on the internet! You are able to send and receive bitcoin without a middle-man, no banks, no credit lenders involved! To this day, it still remains a mystery who Satoshi is.</p>
